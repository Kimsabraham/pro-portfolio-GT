## Description

For this homework we were tasked to create our professional portfolio, using the html and css knowledge. Their were many challengs to this project but the main one was getting your layout the way you wanted. I soon learned the limitations of flexbox and found myself studing grids as well. This project show cases both styles in my layout.
